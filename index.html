  <div class="headline">Sports in the US</div>
  <div class="teaser">In the US many people like to watch and play really different sports.
    <p>The USA is a very successful nation in terms of sports.Of course, one should not forget that there are also 315 million people, which makes it one of the most populous countries in the world. This must be taken into account when evalating the USA's sporting achievements internationally, because the US naturally has a hugepool of talents. The USA is also known for its social program with cheerleaders and lots of show and dance. Collagesport is also very important in the USA and various scholarships are dependent on both athletics and academic performance. As everywhere, howerver, there are also focal points and not every spoert is equally popular in America. On the contrary, the USA differs from the other countries of the western world very clearly. It is striking that football (called soccer in the USA) is not the most popular sport in the country. The most popular sports are clearly American football, basketball and baseball. These, in turn, are rather unknown in most European countries. The games of the professional leagues National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB) are well attended and the most important games are also a top-class TV event nationwide. Winter sports, especially ice hockey with the professional league National Hockey League (NHL) are also very popular. </p>
