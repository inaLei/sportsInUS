      <h1>Soccer</h1>
      <p>Since soccer is a <b>global sport</b>, it has a dictionary that might not be familiar to the <b>American fan or player</b>. Here’s the <b>easiest</b> one. The reason it’s <b>not</b> normally called <b>football</b> here is to <b>avoid confusion</b>. 
<b>Unlike</b> other sports where the rules <b>change every season</b>, soccer is very <b>conservative</b>. The rules of the game are called <b>"The Laws"</b> and can only be changed by a <b>meeting of representatives</b> from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. That makes changes rare and the <b>rules</b> fairly straightforward. You can get a copy of the Laws of the <b>Game from</b> <span onmouseover="showTT('fifa')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>FIFA</span>. It’s the <b>international governing body</b> for soccer that runs <b>the World Cup</b>. That’s the <b>biggest tournament</b> in soccer that features <b>32 National Teams</b> that <b>qualify by region</b>. There are <b>10 players</b> and <b>one goalkeeper</b> per team on the field. To <b>win</b>, you have to shoot the ball into the <b>opponent's goal</b> more often than the opposing team in yours.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The <b>USL Championship</b> was formed when <b>two existing professional leagues</b> were <b>combined</b> into a single league property before the <b>2011 season</b>. The league was designed to help ensure the long-term stability of professional soccer in North America and featured 12 teams in a pair of six-team divisions during its <b>initial campaign</b>. Among the league’s <b>founding members</b> were five <span onmouseover="showTT('teams')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>longtime USL clubs</span> with more than <b>100 years</b> of operation among them.
      </p>
      <h2>The Soccer Field</h2>
      <p>The <b>Basics</b> of Soccer, similar to baseball, there’s no set <b>field dimensions</b>. Instead, soccer uses <b>minimums</b> and <b>maximums</b> allowing fields to <b>fit within</b> those dimensions. The length has to be somewhere between <b>100 yards (91m)</b>and <b>130 yards (119m)</b> and the width between <b>50 yards (46m)</b> and <b>100 yards (91m)</b>. That’s a big difference, so the rules are tighter for <b>international games</b>. These top tier games need fields between 110 (100m) and 120 yards (110m) that are between 70 (64m) and 80 yards (73m) wide. Regardless of the overall size, the goal (8 feet (2,4m) high by 8 yards (7,3m) wide), the six-yard box immediately in front of the goal, and the 18-yard box all have to be exactly those dimensions. The soccer field is also called "pitch".
</p>
<h2>The Clock</h2>
<p>The game lasts 90 minutes plus stoppage time. There are two halves of 45 minutes each and.  Since the clock doesn’t stop in soccer, the referee adds time back at the end of each half to make up for pauses in play. The referee indicates how much time gets added, but it’s not exact. That means a 90 minute game normally lasts 94 minutes or longer at the discretion of the referee. In soccer, players play until the referee blows the whistle.
</p>
<h2>The Referee</h2>
<p>There’s normally one referee on the field who controls the whistle and the cards. In soccer, punishment is doled out through the referee raising a yellow or red card. A yellow card warns a player for breaking the rules. If the incident is serious, the referee can hold up a red card. Than the player isn't able to play the rest of the game, with his team unable to put in a sub. That’s called ‘playing a man down’ and it means the team plays with 10 instead of 11 players. Two yellow cards to the same player also equals a red and a sending off. A team can play with no less than 7 players on the field. If a foul happens in the 18-yard-box, the referee can award a penalty. That means the fouled team gets to take a kick directly at the goalkeeper from the <span onmouseover="showTT('penaltyspot')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>penalty spot</span> 12 yards from the center of the goal line.
</p>
<h2>The Ball</h2>
<p>Soccer balls come in sizes. A young player use a size 3, older Players use size 4,  adults a size 5 ball. Balls used to be made of leather, weren’t waterproof. The modern <span onmouseover="showTT('ball')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>soccer ball</span> is normally made with a plastic covering and is surprisingly light.
</p>
<h2>The positions</h2>
<p>At professionelsoccer there’s 11 players per side, with three substitutes  from the players on the bench. Once a player subs out, they’re done for the game. Soccer is roughly divided into four positions,  the goalkeeper, the defender, the Midfielder and the Forward:
</p>
<h4>The Goalkeeper</h4>
<p>The <span onmouseover="showTT('goalkeeper')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>goalkeeper</span> is the only player on the field who is allowed to use their hands when the ball is in play. He or she can't use their hands outside of the 18-yard box. His job is using his or her entire body to keep the ball from crossing the goal line so the other team doesn’t score. The goalkeeper always wears a different color shirt so he or she is easy to spot by the referee. Traditionally, that shirt was green.
  </p>
  <h4>Defender</h4>
  <p>A basic formation in soccer is 4-4-2. Formations only apply to field players cause you have to have a goalkeeper.  You read the formation starting with the defender. The first 4 in the 4-4-2 means four defenders, the players in front of the goalkeeper.  There  aren't always four defenders.  The team can play in any formation the coach wants. The main task  of the defender is to block the opposing players so that they can't score a goal.
  </p>
  <h4>Midfielder</h4>
  <p>Midfielders take on attacking and defensive responsibilities, linking the defenders with the forwards and trying to keep the flow of play going. Unlike American football, the positions aren’t set with complicated playbooks. A midfielder can defend and attack.
  </p>
  <h4>Forward</h4>
  <p>Forwards are the players most expected to score goals. From an offensive perspective, formations are designed to get the ball to the attacking players so they can do their job.
