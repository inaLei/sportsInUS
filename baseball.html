      <h1>Major League Baseball (MLB)</h1>
        <p>One of the most popular sports in the USA. Americans are so <b>passionate</b> about the sport that a weekend trip to the ballpark is a family affair. To this day, it is <b>unclear when people started playing baseball</b>. From numerous legacies of ancient Egypt, it appears that long before the birth of Christ, games with some sort of bats and balls occurred. Then, around the 14th century, the so-called <span onmouseover="showTT('stoolball')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>Stool Ball</span> was played. A form of the game, from which later developed the <b>well-know cricket</b>. With the development of the sport, it continued in the <b>18th century</b>, which resulted in a variation of the <span onmouseover="showTT('goalball')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>Goal Ball</span>. The name baseball first appeared in England around 1744. The first set of rules came from a writing in a book by the German sports educator Johann Christoph Friedrich Gutsmuth in 1796. 
        </p>
      <h2>The principle of the game</h2>
        <p>Two teams consisting of nine players, face each other in baseball. The teams can score points by expiring the so-called <b>bases</b>. For each of the bases the playersreceive a point, if they run through in the correct order. The order is clearly defined: first the 1st, then it goes to the 2nd, over the 3rd to then run over the last base the home plate. The team with the right to attack starts. A player  may not start running until the <span onmouseover="showTT('batter')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>batter</span> has hit the thrown ball into the field. The batter then also becomes a runner. The player must conditionally reach the  next base before one of the defending players of the other team can hold the ball in his hands again to score a point. If the players do not succeed, they are counted out. The time a player has to run is determinded by the ball, the further it is hit the harder it is for the opposing team to catch it again. If the runner reaches the base before he is out, he can stay on the base until the next player of his team comes to bat at the so-called home plate. Once three members of a team have been counted out, it is the turn of the competitors. A <span onmouseover="showTT('run')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>run</span> is over when both teams have had an <span onmouseover="showTT('atbat')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>at-bat</span>. In Major League Baseball, 9 innigs are conducted. The team with the most points is the winner. The game process is divided into three phases.
        </p>
      <h2>Phase 1</h2>
        <p>The player with the right to attack, steps to the home plate with the bat(baseball bat). The player may not run until the batter brings the ball into fair territory. If the batter does not hit the ball and is caught by the player behind, it counts as a <b>strike</b>. If there are three strikes, it is the opposing team´s turn.
        </p>
      <h2>Phase 2</h2>
        <p>If the batter is able to hit the ball into fair territory, he becomes <b>a runner</b> and must immediately attempt to reach 1st base before being counted out. During an inning, the pitcher of the defensive team throws the ball towards a member of the offensive team currently in batting position at home plate. The batter attempts to hit the ball with the bat to a location out of the reach of the defensive players in the field and run around the bases. If he is able to round the bases and return to home plate, he scores a run. But if the ball is caught, or can be thrown to first base before he arrives at the base, then the batter is <b>out</b>. A batter is also put out if he strikes out, or fails to hit the baseball three times after <b>three good pitches</b>. The offensive team´s time at bat is over when it gets three outs. If the ball is hit out of bounds this is foul territory and is also penalized as an out.
        </p>
      <h2>Phase 3</h2>
        <p>Once the ball is hit, the runner can make his way to the next base. If a player manages to hit the ball in such a way that it flies out of the boundary of the field, but remains within the fair territory, this is called a <b>home run</b> in baseball. In this case it is extremely difficult for the opposing team to catch the ball or bring it back towards 1st base and a lot of runners manage to run across the entire bases into the goal, but this is the exception. If the runner leaves his base before the ball is hit, it is a <b>steal</b> attempt 
        (invalid attempt). A Runner can also be forced to vacate the Base by the following Runner, as only one Runner may be on a Base (Forced Play situation). If two runners  are counted out, it is called a double play, and if three are counted out, it is called a triple play. If the game is interrupted by a <span onmouseover="showTT('deadball')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>dead ball</span>, all runners must return to their starting base, this is also valid for players who have attempted a steal.
