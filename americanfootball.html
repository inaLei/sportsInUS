<h2>Rules NFL - American Football</h2>
<p><b>American football</b> has been the most popular sport in America for decades, next to baseball. <b>Tournaments</b> are held on a regular basis, and they are played in the <b>NFL</b>. The <b>NFL</b> is the <b>National Football League</b>, in which only the professionals play.
</p>
<h2>How does American football work?</h2> 
<p>There are <span onmouseover="showTT('types')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>different types</span> of American football, but they all have the same rules and number of players. Two types include the <b>NFL</b> and <b>college football</b>. The goal of this team sport is to get the <b>eggshaped leather ball</b> into the opponent´s territory and score a <b>touchdown</b> if possible. American football is a <b>physically difficult</b> sport, as opponents are sometimes pushed away with all their might. However, contrary to the name, the ball is thrown and caught <b>only with the hands</b>.
</p>
<h2>Structure and rules of the game</h2>
<p>A game of American football lasts <b>exactly 60 minutes</b>. These 60 minutes are divided into <span onmouseover="showTT('quarters')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>four quarters</span>. After the 1st and 3rd quarter there is a break of <b>2 minutes each</b>, at the end of the 2nd quarter the break lasts <b>12 minutes</b>. During the short breaks, the teams are <b>re-sorted</b>. The number of players is the same as in <span onmouseover="showTT('number')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>European soccer</span>. However, each team has two teams divided into the <b>defense</b> and <b>offense</b>. The team is set up whether to <b>attack</b> or to <b>defend</b>. On one side of the field stands the attacking team, on the other side waits the defense. The <b>kickoff</b> is the <b>only moment</b>, when the ball is kicked with the foot. Someone from the defense kicks the ball in the <b>direction of the attackers</b>. The offense must now get the ball in their hands to get the ball to a <b>certain end point</b> in the opponent's zone. If they succeed, that's the <b>touchdown</b>. If the defense wrests the ball from the attacking team, the teams switch. This means that the previously attacking team now becomes the defending one and vice versa. This can happen as many times as necessary until the last quarter ends. If there is no winner, the game goes into a <b>15-minute overtime period</b>.
</p>
<h2>The Teams</h2>
<p>The <b>offensive teams</b> each consist of two <span onmouseover="showTT('guards')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>guards</span>, two <span onmouseover="showTT('tackels')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>tackels</span>, a <span onmouseover="showTT('quarterback')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>quarterback</span>, a <span onmouseover="showTT('runningback')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>running back</span>, a <span onmouseover="showTT('tight ')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>tight end</span>, a <span onmouseover="showTT('wide')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>wide receiver</span>, and the rest of the players</b>. These players also called <b>centers</b>. The <b>leader</b> of the team is the <b>quarterback</b>. During the kickoff the quarterback receives the ball from the center to find, while running back a person who brings the ball into the <b>opponent's end zone</b>. If no one is free, the captain tries it himself. The <b>defensive teams</b> consists of the <span onmouseover="showTT('nose')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>nose guard</span>, defensive ends, <span onmouseover="showTT('linebackers')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>linebackers</span>, <span onmouseover="showTT('defensivetackles')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>defensive tackles</span>, and <span onmouseover="showTT('safeties')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>safeties</span>. The defense's job is relatively simple: to prevent offenses from getting into the end zone.
</p>
<h2>The NFL</h2>
<p>The <b>professional league</b> in American football consists of <span onmouseover="showTT('anzahl')" onmouseout="hideTT()" class='tooltipText'>32 teams</span>. They are firmly arranged in the <b>American Football Conference (AFC)</b> and the <b>National Football Conference (NFC)</b>. They are divided into <b>four divisions</b>. After a preseason lasting several weeks, in which only test games are practiced, the <b>real season</b> begins, which lasts <b>17 weeks</b>. During the season <b>each individual team</b> plays <b>16 games</b>. The teams with the <b>most points</b> then play in the <b>playoffs</b> for the <b>championship title</b>. Then, once the <b>Conference of AFC and NFL</b> has <b>announced the winners</b>, they compete in the famous <b>Super Bowl</b>. These <b>Super Bowls</b> achieve the <b>highest ratings</b> every year, and always take place on the <b>first Sunday in February</b>.
